&ldquo;Muslim Women Voices&rdquo; is an interactive website that showcases
the opinions and accomplishments of Muslim women. A large portion of the
media, in today's day and time, portrays Muslim women as weak and oppressed.
This project was created to tell an opposing narrative, showing the opinions
and strengths of them, instead.
