This is a random meme generator. With a click of the mouse, new nouns
appear after “YOU GET” and “EVERYBODY ELSE GETS.” Due to the increase in
so-called meme culture, I made this project–it showcases my and everybody
else’s love for memes. Although some may not make much sense, it is still
a humorous and interactive way to embrace the trends of this decade.
