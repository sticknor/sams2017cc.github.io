My Project is an interactive sandbox. I placed images sourced from DeviantArt
and Nintendo together onto a canvas and let them interact with each other
along with key presses. Each object on the screen is its own sprite, some
in groups and some being solo. Kirby is the interaction which can be
controlled by pressing the arrow keys. By pressing the F key, you can have
Kirby punch. Try punching some of the objects on the screen and see if they
interact with one another.
