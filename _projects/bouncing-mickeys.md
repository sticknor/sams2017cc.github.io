This piece is an interactive animation of Mickey Mice (?) bouncing throughout
the screen. The position where the Mickeys appear is dependent on where the
cursor is. To add smaller (baby?) Mickeys to the screen, click the mouse and
they will appear at randomly generated positions.

This project was based on the experimentation of creating items that could
interact with each other. As an added bonus, I decided to also add the Mickey
Mouse giggle every time the Mickeys bounce together. (I must warn you that when
the Mickeys inevitably bounce together at rapid speeds the sound can become
slightly overwhelming.) The project also included aspects of other projects
(e.g. <code>if</code> statements, sound files, and lists) to help make the animation appear
more realistic.
