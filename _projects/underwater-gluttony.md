My project is a game that involves the interaction of fish with other
underwater sea dwellers. The fish can be moved around using the up, down,
left, and right directional keys. As the fish consumes more food, it is able
to grow larger in size.

I made this because the very first object that I coded was this exact orange
fish. At first, the fish was drawn in code using p5's polygonal shapes.
However, for this project, I used Adobe Illustrator and
Photoshop to help create sprites. After cropping the figures to just the
right size, I was able to load them into the code and bring them to life!
I learned that there are a myriad of programs and resources that programmers
and coders need to use in order to achieve their goals. I, for one, have never
taken a coding or programming course and thought that it would be interesting
to create a game of my own that had a theme. Although the sprites for the
fish and sea dwellers were time consuming, it was totally worth it to see my
creations flop around.
