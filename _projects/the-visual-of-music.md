This is a music pitch visualizer&mdash;the various shapes move based on each
specific pitch, with the lower pitches to the left and the higher
pitches to the right. Each scene also corresponds with the theme of each song.
I made this visualizer due to my passion in music, and my own performance on
flute is showcased in the last scene. Music is usually thought of as an
aural experience, so this is a means to experience music in a different way.
