This is a sound visualizer&mdash;the Spongebobs move based on the pitches of
the inputted sound, with the lower pitches to the left and the higher pitches
to the right. You can play a song to see the various pitches in the song or
speak into the computer mic to see your voice. I made this visualizer to be
a more interactive version of my music visualizer.
