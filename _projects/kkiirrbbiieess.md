This piece is a visual animation of seventeen different Kirbies rotating
through a list in a flashing form. This project was based on an exercise
where the class learned the random number generator, in combination with
lists and picture downloads.

Many students in the course were experimenting with colour blocks, like
ellipses and rectangles. In the previous class, we had just learned how to use
images, and I wanted to combine the two lessons into one project. So, instead
of shapes, I decided to import coloured Kirbies.
