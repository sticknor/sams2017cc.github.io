This piece is my attempt to give the illusion of and mimic the 3D world
that we see everyday. Because this is a completely 2D animation, I needed
precise equations to accurately model the apparent size, speed, perspective,
and interactions between everyday objects.

Drag and click the mouse. See what happens.
