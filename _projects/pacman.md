R - Restart <br/>
Arrow Keys - Move PacMan

This code is a play on the popular game Pac-Man, though without the popular
ghosts that follow PacMan around. I decided to omit their presence in order
to provide the player with a shorter, less stressful version of the game,
hoping that the message of changing rigid outlooks would be received by
those who play it. I hope that you enjoy my piece and that it gave you
a new way of thinking about something so simple, yet so fixed; a video game.
