This piece is an animation of the moon turning into the Cheshire Cat and
speaking one of his most famous phrases.

This project was based on the assignment where the objective was importing
and utilising images and/or sound files.  Originally I attempted to make the
sketch without importing the image of the Cheshire Cat, and it had not turned
out as aesthetically pleasing as I had originally hoped. Importing the image
of his face and using my previously drawn moon gave the animation the feeling
I was looking for, and also allowed me to add the sound files. During this
project I learned a lot about scaling, loops, if statements, and
incrementation. Using all these aspects I was able to create an interesting
animation that portrayed the Cheshire Cat true to his nature.

<i>Note: This is not a looping animation,
in order to to replay the animation, refresh.</i>
