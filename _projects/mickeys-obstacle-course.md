This piece is an interactive video game with a Mickey Mouse avatar.
The objective is to complete all ten levels (although I must warn you,
it is very difficult to do so). Use the arrows to control the avatar
while avoiding the bars and eventually the moving Donald Ducks to get to the
right side of the screen, indicated by a green finish line completing the
level, until level 10 is completed.

I created a Mickey Mouse drawing out of p5.js shapes for the first project
in Creative Coding, and I wanted to use it as a stepping stone for the final
project. Taking skills learned from previous projects (e.g. random number
generation, lists, p5.play, images, text, and interactivity) and combining
them into one project. It was a real test of my capabilities as a creative
coder, but also a fun project to make!

<i>Note: sometimes the game will restart you at level 1 regardless of whether or not you deserve it.</i>
