An online exhibition for a project class on <i>Creative Coding</i>, the use
of programming as an artistic medium, offered in 2017 through the <i>Summer
  Academy for Mathematics and Science</i> at <i>Carnegie Mellon University</i>.
Over the course of six weeks, students developed coding experience and a body
of creative work through prompt-based exercises and longer, self-directed
projects. We will be presenting these projects with a selection of smaller
exercises on this website soon!
